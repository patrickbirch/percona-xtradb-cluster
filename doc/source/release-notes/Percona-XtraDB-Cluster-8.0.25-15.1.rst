Release Highlights
=================================================

A Non-Blocking Operation method for online schema changes in Percona XtraDB Cluster. This mode is similar to the Total Order Isolation (TOI) mode, whereas a data definition language (DDL) statement (for example, ``ALTER``) is executed on all nodes in sync. The difference is that in the NBO mode, the DDL statement acquires a metadata lock that locks the table or schema at a late stage of the operation, which is a more efficient locking strategy.

Note that the NBO mode is a **Tech Preview** feature. We do not recommend that you use this mode in a production environment. For more information, see :ref:`nbo`.

The notable changes and bug fixes introduced by Oracle MySQL include the following:

* The ``sql_slave_skip_counter`` variable only counts the events in the uncompressed transaction payloads.
* A possible deadlock occurred when system variables, read by different clients, were being updated and the binary log file was rotated.
* Sometimes the aggregate function results could return values from a previous statement when using a prepared ``SELECT`` statement with a ``WHERE`` clause that is always false.
