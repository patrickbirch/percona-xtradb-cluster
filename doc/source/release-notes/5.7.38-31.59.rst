Bugs Fixed
=============================================================================

* :jirabug:`PXC-3118`: A fix for when, using a thread pool, a brute force abort for a metadata locking (MDL) subsystem conflict stalled.

* :jirabug:`PXC-3951`: Updated how `sst-idle-timeout` calculates disk usage. The default timeout value for the variable is 120 seconds. If the joiner node does not detect a disk usage difference in that time, the node terminates the SST. The current calculation could return the same value for 120 seconds.

* :jirabug:`PXC-2367`: When enabled, the event scheduler filled the error logs with a "Ready state reached" message. The message's logging level was reduced to "debug" and only logged in the error logs when `wsrep_debug = 1`.

* :jirabug:`PXC-3961`: Reduced the strictness of checks which had marked `GNo=0` invalid. In Percona XtraDB Cluster, writesets are replicated to other nodes with `GNo=0`. The generation of seqno or GTID occurs later in the pre-commit phase. A recent version had increased the strictness of these checks which caused the GTID event from 5.6 to be considered invalid.
